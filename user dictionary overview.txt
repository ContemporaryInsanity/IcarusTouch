NOTES:
"absolute" means, starting from the KEYBOARDs x position, NOT the windows x position.


## Keyboard Touches ##
  graphical data:
["initial_key"]["keynumber_absolute"] = number of first pressed key: starting from 0 as the lowest note of the visible (5-octave) keyboard
["initial_key"]["keyposition_absolute_x"] = pixel position of first pressed key: starting from 0 as the left edge of the lowest note of the visible (5-octave) keyboard
["blob"] = contains the blob-widget of this touch
["keys"] = contains a list of all keys illuminated by this touch (after they fade out, they are removed from this list)

  needed by the round algorithm:
["finger_position"] = current absolute fingerposition in pixels
["rounded_key"] = current perfect key position under the finger (= in the middle of the key)
["key_moving"] = false or true: if the pixel threshold is exceeded, it gets true
["current_position"] = the actual position calculated by the rounding algorithm and to be sent over midi (after the pixelposition -> pitch height calculation)
["old_position"] = the old value of "current_position"
["vibrato"] = false or true (not yet implemented): gives the possibility of doing vibrato with perfect centered ("computer aided") pitch, regardless of whether pitch lock ("full rounding") is active or not.


## Scroll Touches ##
["scroll"] = True
